# Chapter 1: Computer Vision & Deep Learning â€“ First Steps

In this introductory chapter, a simple neuron network is developed from scratch, step by step:

- [neuron.py](neuron.py) shows how to model a single *artificial neuron* able to forward information;
- [fully_connected_layer.py](fully_connected_layer.py) implements a functional *layer* grouping several neurons, with methods to optimize its parameters;
- [simple_network.py](simple_network.py) wraps everything together into a modular *neural network* model which can be trained and used for various tasks.

Finally, in [ch1_notebook.py](ch1_notebook.py), we demonstrate how each of these elements work, and how to apply the resulting neural network to a meaningful task.
